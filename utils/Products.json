                "message": "UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED! \n\n Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable. \n\n The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long. \n\n Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using swap memory where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board. \n\n ***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB. \n\n I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models. \n \n There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD. \n\n ***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly."

Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well."
